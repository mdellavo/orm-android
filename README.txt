ORM for Android

Mostly an experimental/work in progress ORM inspired by SQLAlchemy.

There is a very basic smoke test in the test directory which serves as an example of use.

TODO
 - a better name
 - Flesh out the rest of the Connection/Session/etc
 - Clean up and refactor SchemaBuilder
 - Serializer, deserializer interface
 - Relations
 - Actual unit tests (ie - not just using junit as a test harness for a smoke test)
